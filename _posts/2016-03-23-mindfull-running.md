Mindful running is a well-known concept for meditator go runners. It's a concept that helped elite marathoner and ultra runners to improve their training and racing times. In this article we'll se how can it help you.

I read an article in <a href="http://running.competitor.com/2016/03/news/run-with-mindfulness_147098?utm_source=exact_target&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=7223676&utm_content=032316_best" target="_blank">competitor.com</a> about mindful running and strike my attention. At first I tought that was an article to attract people in yoga pants and reading motivation books. But reading further reveal a useful reading.

## What Is Mindful Running And Why Should You Care

As normal in philosophy terms and meanings are not 100% define. Mindful is a current social meme and we hear it all the time, mindful eating, living mindfully, etc. Being mindful is not more than being aware of your environment, that includes yourself, both your body and your emotions.

This translates to paying attention to different things while you run. By being aware of your breathing, your thoughts, your emotions, your pain, your surroundings. This will help you have a better understanding of your running and how everything is connected. The bottom line, it will help you run better and faster by improving how your body and mind react to training.

### How will this improve your running

#### Intention

Intention and porpoise will help your mind be more present. It's also a great way to set a goal for each run and train better

#### Breathing

Running is breathing base sport. Your breathing basically helps you set your running pace, so a bad or irregular breathing will make your pace erratic. Focus on your breathing and concentrate in making it regular as cam as possible. If you are doing an easy workout you should be able to talk in full sentences.

When aware of your breathing you can pace yourself better and be more efficient on you use of energy.

#### Form And Body

Being aware of your running form helps you make little adjustments when necessary. That way you can prevent an injury or make your running more efficient and natural. Knowing when you have gone to far in a training or workout and need to step back. Those are all important components of a good training.

#### Recovery, Nutrition And Everything Else

Being conscious in every workout lets you asses your effort level in each training. That way you can readjust your training when necessary. More rest, more effort, extra reps, whatever feels right in the moment.

### Those this sound like crazy talk to you?

Think it this way; we are told to do visualization and mental exercises to prepare for important events and improve our performance. If mental preparation has an important part in our performance it makes sence that we also train the mind as we train the body. Meditation is a path to achieve this. Meditation is one of many ways to being mindful.
