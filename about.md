We all are meant to be runners. I does not matter if its 1k, 1 mile, 16 miles, or an ultra marathons. All we need to do to start running is lace up and get out the door. But it takes more than legs to be a great runner.

My name is Erwin Henriquez. I’m from Valencia, Venezuela. I am a runner enthusiastic. I started running around 2011 while living in New York. From 125th St. to Battery Park that was the run that changed me. After that I realized how much I enjoy running. Last year I pick it up again, this time with a more serious approach. After building up from 3k to a full 10k race, I start my first half marathon training. 12 weeks of hard training that took me to the limit, physically and mentally. But I made it! a PR of 1h:53m in the 13.1 miles that seem like a never-ending test. I had the support from my family and even my father ran with me that day. It was in a simple word EPIC.

I guess that like all runners, after your first goal completed you start felling like a junkie. You need more races, more miles, more challenges, more trainings. Otherwise you just get stuck in the “what now?” after a big race. This is my *what now?*

I am dedicating part of my free time, otherwise know as training time, to get this blog up. In here you will found my training log so you can see my progress. Hopefully it will inspire you as well. But lets face it WE ARE MORE THAN RUNNERS. We also eat delicious food (with a lot of carbs some times). We do drills, strength training, yoga, ride bike, play sports, go for a walk, or maybe some trail runs, and a bunch of other stuff. You will also find all that in here.
